          Block version 1.<br>
          <br>
          Version 1 was introduced in the genesis block (January 2009).<br>
          <br>
          Version 2 was introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.7.0 (September 2012) as a soft fork. As described in BIP34, valid
          version 2 blocks require a block height parameter in the coinbase. Also described in BIP34 are rules for rejecting
          certain blocks; based on those rules, Bitcoin Core 0.7.0 and later versions began to reject version 2 blocks without
          the block height in coinbase at block height 224,412 (March 2013) and began to reject new version 1 blocks three weeks
          later at block height 227,930.<br>
          <br>
          Version 3 blocks were introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.10.0 (February 2015) as a soft fork. When the fork reached full
          enforcement (July 2015), it required strict DER encoding of all ECDSA signatures in new blocks as described in BIP66.
          Transactions that do not use strict DER encoding had previously been non-standard since Bitcoin Core 0.8.0 (February 2012).<br>
          <br>
          Version 4 blocks specified in BIP65 and introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 (November 2015) as a soft fork became active
          in December 2015. These blocks now support the new OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode described in that BIP.<br>

          <h2>Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks</h2>
          <h3>Billions may be needed as lending squeeze tightens</h3>
          <b>Francis Elliott</b> Deputy Political Editor<br>
          <b>Gary Duncan</b> Economics Editor<br>
          <br>
          <img style="float: right; width:30%" src="thetimes.png" />
          Alistair Darling has been forced to consider a second bailout for banks as the lending drought worsens.<br>
          <p>The Chancellor will decide within weeks whether to pump billions more into the economy as evidence mounts that
          the £37 billion part-nationalisation last year has failed to keep credit flowing. Options include cash injections,
          offering banks cheaper state guarantees to raise money privately or buying up &ldquo;toxic assets&rdquo;, The
          Times has learnt.</p>
          <p>The Bank of England revealed yesterday that, despite intense pressure, the banks curbed lending in the final
          quarter of last year and plan even lighter restrictions in the coming months. Its findings will alarm the
          Treasury.</p>
          <p>The Bank is expected to take yet more aggressive action this week by cutting the base rate from its current
          level of 2 per cent. Doing so would reduce the cost of borrowing but have little effect on the availability of
          loans.</p>
          <p>Whitehall sources said that ministers planned to &ldquo;keep the banks on the boil&rdquo; but accepted that
          they need more help to restore lending levels. Formally, the Treasury plans to focus on state-backed gurantees to
          encourage private finance, but a number of interventions are on the table, including further injections of
          taxpayers&rsquo; cash.</p> 
          <p>Under one option, a &ldquo;bad bank&rdquo; would be created to dispose of bad debts. The Treasury would take
          bad loans off the hands of troubled banks, perhaps swapping them for government bonds. The toxic assets, blamed
          for poisoning the financial system, would be parked in a state vehicle or &ldquo;bad bank&rdquo; that would manage
          them and attempt to dispose of them while &ldquo;detoxifying&rdquo; the mainstream banking system.</p>
          <p>The idea would mirror the initial proposal by Henry Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, to underpin the
          American banking system by buying up toxic assets. The idea was abandoned, ironically, when Mr Paulson decided to
          follow Britain&rsquo;s plan of injecting cash directly into troubled banks.</p>
          <p>Mr Darling, Gordon Brown and Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, are expected to take the final decision on
          what extra help to give the banks by the end of the month.</p>
          <p>The banks have taken much of the heat for the economy&rsquo;s woes. But ministers are said increasingly to
          accept that attacking the banks will not by itself transform a situation that is jeopardising Britain&rsquo;s
          economic prospects.</p>
          <p>Insiders point out that Mr Darling&rsquo;s criticism of mortgage lenders has softened in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>After the Bank of England&rsquo;s radical cuts in interest rates over the past two months, the focus at the
          Treasury has shifted away from mortgage lending to the pressure being put on businesses by the scarcity of loans,
          which is emerging as the bigger economic danger.</p>
          <p>Richard Lambert, the Director-General of the CBI, said yesterday: &ldquo;The Government is going to have to do
          more to restore credit flows across the economy.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He said that the car industry was especially vulnerable: &ldquo;Without access to credit or loan guarantees on
          commercial terms, this vital part of the economy will incur lasting damage.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The scale of the lending drought was highlighted as separate Bank figures showed that the number of new home
          loans approved plunged to a record lose in November. Only 27,000 mortgages for house purchase were approved by
          banks and building societies, down from a revised 31,000 in October. It is the lowest level since the Bank began
          collecting data in 1999. The Bank&rsquo;s quarterly credit conditions survey showed that banks restricted access
          to loans of all kinds by companies and consumers in the past quarter, and that they plan to tighten the screws
          more in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Halifax reported that the price of the average house fell by more than £100 a day last year. Its quarterly
          figures showed that the average house ended the year down in price by £37,178, or 162 per cent.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Pressing their point</h3>
          &ldquo;The single most pressing challenge to economic policy is to get the banking system to get lending in any
          normal sense&rdquo;<br>
          <b>Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, Nov 26</b><br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;They are close to cutting off their noses to spite their faces&rdquo;<br>
          <b>Lord Mandelson, Business Secretary, accuses the banks of being too conservative, Nov 30</b><br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;The banks have to understand that we have put substantial sums of public money in to support them. They,
          in turn, need to play their part&rdquo;<br>
          <b>Alistair Darling, Dec 10</b><br>
          <br>
          &ldquo;Quite clearly a lot more needs to be done&rdquo;<br>

          Little-endian order number 0x12A05F200, which equals 5000000000 in decimal. This is the coinbase miner subsidy of 
          <b>50 BTC</b> in the first reward era. Satoshis are the standard notation for all amounts in the bitcoin 
          protocol.<br>
          <br>
          Every 210000 blocks, the miner subsidy is cut in half (the halving). After 33 halvings there is no more miner
          subsidy, and the transaction fees pay for the mining expenditure and the security of the network.<br>
          <br>
          When all the halvings are done, there have been 20999999.97690000 bitcoin mined, thus 2310000 satoshis short 
          of 21 million.<br>
          <br>
          The 21 million is actually not in the code. The subsidy per block is derived the starting value of 50 BTC per 
          block, and divide that block subsidy by 2 for every 210000 blocks.
          <blockquote>
          int64 CBlock::GetBlockValue(int64 nFees) const<br>
          {<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Subsidy is cut in half every 4 years<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nSubsidy >>= (nBestHeight / 210000);<br>

          The lower limit on the size of a transaction (the dust limit) is 546 satoshis. However, for the coinbase
          transaction (the mining subsidy), this limit is not applicable.
